People are not using electrical appliances efficiently this may be reason that our country 
is third largest country in electricity consumption.This leads to the wastage of electricity 
as well as money. Often in places for example in offices we find that fans are running unnecessarily. 
And also, nowadays controlling electronic appliances are done through remote control. 
But people with difficulties will find it hard to operate a remote and also the design,
structure and function of remote varies from appliance to appliance and also from brand-to-brand,
it will be difficult to operate such devices by old people. Thus, this smart fan will be able to 
solve those problems. 


This project is about voice controlled smart fan that can be controlled through phone. Since voice 
can be captured faster than writing or typing hence, we can say that voice-controlled appliance is 
more effective and easier to use. Here speech to text conversion takes place and the instructions are 
sent via cloud platform and then the fan runs according to the sent instructions. This voice controlled 
smart fan will be of great helpful to people with movement disorder as well as for visually impaired people.

Unlike your regular ceiling fan where the only connection is a pull cord or wiring in your wall, smart
ceiling fans operate via Wi-Fi. This means you can remotely control and program them to operate within a
given setting while you are away from home with your Android device.
